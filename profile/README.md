# QB Networks Ethical Declaration ‚Äî Principles with Inspirational Notes

1. **Human Dignity is Fundamental**  
   All our activities center on human dignity. Technology, data, software, or decision-making mechanisms must never supersede humanity.  
   *‚ÄúA human is God‚Äôs vicegerent on earth; anything that harms them betrays the divine trust.‚Äù* ‚Äî Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)

2. **Ethical Leadership Stems from Responsibility**  
   Decision-making power comes not from authority but from integrity and accountability. Leadership finds meaning in serving the community.  
   *‚ÄúLeadership is about offering freedom to others.‚Äù* ‚Äî Richard Stallman, Founder of the Free Software Movement

3. **Pluralism is Strength**  
   Diverse voices and disciplines are not conflict but richness. We believe in a dialogue culture that listens and unites.  
   *‚ÄúDifferences are God‚Äôs law. Respecting them is what makes us human.‚Äù* ‚Äî Alija Izetbegoviƒá

4. **Open Knowledge is a Shared Asset**  
   Knowledge is not to be hoarded but shared. Openness means not just access but virtuous production.  
   *‚ÄúKnowledge is the foundation of freedom; sharing it grows humanity‚Äôs legacy.‚Äù* ‚Äî Linus Torvalds, Linux Kernel Developer

5. **Consultation with Community Shapes Decisions**  
   Final decisions may rest with the decision-maker, but the process is shaped by the community. We build open, learning, and participatory decision structures.  
   *‚ÄúA community‚Äôs strength lies in listening to every voice.‚Äù* ‚Äî Eric S. Raymond, Open Source Software Advocate

6. **Balance of Freedom and Responsibility**  
   Freedom is not recklessness but a reflection of responsibility. We uphold this balance in code and relationships.  
   *‚ÄúFreedom is complete only when it respects the freedom of others.‚Äù* ‚Äî Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)

7. **Digital Justice and Accessibility**  
   Our technological solutions must be accessible to all. Justice begins in the digital realm, fostering inclusion, not discrimination.  
   *‚ÄúAccessibility is the conscience of technology.‚Äù* ‚Äî Tim Berners-Lee, Inventor of the World Wide Web

8. **Principles Precede Profit**  
   Profit must never override principles. Ethical production is our definition of sustainability.  
   *‚ÄúMorality must be the compass of every decision.‚Äù* ‚Äî Alija Izetbegoviƒá

9. **Transparency Builds Trust**  
   We are transparent in all our processes. Trust is built through openness and honesty.  
   *‚ÄúTransparency is the soul of a system; without it, nothing endures.‚Äù* ‚Äî Julian Assange, WikiLeaks Founder

10. **Technology Serves Humanity**  
    Technology is a tool for human welfare. Every innovation must benefit society.  
    *‚ÄúTechnology should liberate humanity, not chain it.‚Äù* ‚Äî Aaron Swartz, Open Access Activist

This framework represents QB Networks‚Äô technical, philosophical, and humanistic vision.

## Free Software is all about Freedom of Speech

Please visit [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

## The four essential freedoms

A program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms: 

* The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).

* The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).

* The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

## Our approach to sponsors and partners

We ofcourse like to be partners with sponsors or other organizations that who want to get in touch with us. But our choice is "Free Software Business Model" and we only accept organizations for sponsorship who will write Free Software with us. And also we only accept organizations that we can give technical support and other Free Software services to them...

Thanks for your understanding.
