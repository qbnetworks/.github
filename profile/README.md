## QB Networks Ethics Declaration ‚Äî *Principles with Inspirational Notes*

## 1. **Human Dignity is Fundamental**
We consider human dignity as the center of all our activities. Technology, data, software or decision solutions can never surpass humanity.

*‚ÄúNo idea that does not defend humanity is legitimate.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Aliya Izetbegovic**

## 2. **Ethical Leadership Comes from Responsibility, Not Authority**
We believe in a leadership approach that derives its decision-making power not from above, but from principle and accountability.

*‚ÄúA leader who underestimates his people is the grave digger of the country.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Aliya Izetbegovic**

## 3. **Pluralism is Strength**
Different voices and disciplines, is not a conflict  but a wealth for us. We believe in listening and unifying dialogues.
*‚ÄúDifferences are a law of God. To respect them is to be human.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Aliya Izetbegovic**

## 4. **Open Knowledge is a Common Wealth**
Knowledge is a trust to be shared, not hidden. Openness is not only access, but also *virtuous production*.

*‚ÄúWhen knowledge ceases to be power and is combined with virtue, then civilization becomes.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Aliya Izetbegovic**

## 5. **Consultation with Society Combines with Decision**
Every final decision may be in the hands of the founder, but the process is shaped by community. We want to build decision structures that is based on mutual learn, document and are open to contribution.

*‚ÄúFreedom is the right of only those who are willing to listen to others.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Aliya Izetbegovic**

## 6. **Balance of Freedom and Responsibility**
For us, freedom is not lack of discipline, but a part of responsibility. We observe this balance both in code and in relationships.

*‚ÄúMan is free, but not irresponsible. Freedom without responsibility is anarchy.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Aliya Izetbegovic**

## 7. **Digital Justice and Accessibility**
We design our technological solutions in a way that every individual can access. Justice begins digitally, we produce inclusivity, not discrimination.

*‚ÄúNo justice is complete unless justice reaches everyone.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Aliya Izetbegovic**

## 8. **Principle Comes Before Profit**
Profit can never take precedence over principle. Production without ethical compromise is our definition of sustainability.

*‚ÄúProfit without morality is another form of destruction.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Aliya Izetbegovic**

This structure represents not only the technical, but also the universal and human aspect of QB Networks.

## Free Software is all about Freedom of Speech

Please visit [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

## The four essential freedoms

A program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms: 

* The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).

* The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).

* The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

## Our approach to sponsors and partners

We ofcourse like to be partners with sponsors or other organizations that who want to get in touch with us. But our choice is "Free Software Business Model" and we only accept organizations for sponsorship who will write Free Software with us. And also we only accept organizations that we can give technical support and other Free Software services to them...

Thanks for your understanding.
